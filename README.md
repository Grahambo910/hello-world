Three shall be the number of thy counting, and the number of thy counting shall be three!
Four, shalt thou not count; noither count thou two, exepting that thou then proceed to three.
Once the number three, being the third number reached, lobbeth thou thy holy hand grenade of Antioch
unto thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.
